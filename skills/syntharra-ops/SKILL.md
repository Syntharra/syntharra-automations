# Syntharra Ops — Full Reference

## Session Rules (CRITICAL — Every Chat)

At the **START** of every chat, fetch and read:
1. `Syntharra/syntharra-automations/docs/project-state.md`
2. `Syntharra/syntharra-website/CLAUDE.md`

At the **END** of every chat that changes anything:
1. Update `project-state.md` with what changed
2. Push a session log to `docs/session-logs/` (what changed and why)
3. Push all changes to GitHub before chat ends

---

## GitHub Push (Python pattern)

```python
import requests, base64, json

TOKEN = "{{GITHUB_TOKEN}}"
headers = {"Authorization": f"token {TOKEN}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

def push_file(repo, path, content_str, commit_msg):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/Syntharra/{repo}/contents/{path}"
    r = requests.get(url, headers=headers).json()
    sha = r.get("sha")  # None if new file
    payload = {
        "message": commit_msg,
        "content": base64.b64encode(content_str.encode()).decode()
    }
    if sha:
        payload["sha"] = sha
    requests.put(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
```

**Never commit raw token strings to GitHub** — replace with placeholder variables before pushing. GitHub secret scanning will block the push.

## Ops Monitor

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Repo | `Syntharra/syntharra-ops-monitor` |
| URL | `syntharra-ops-monitor-production.up.railway.app` |
| Railway service ID | `7ce0f943-5216-4a16-8aeb-794cc7cc1e65` |
| Status | **PAUSED** (2026-03-30 — stop test-mode alert spam) |

### Monitor Systems (10 total, 70+ checks)
1. Retell — agent health
2. n8n — workflow execution errors
3. Supabase — table accessibility
4. Stripe — webhook, product validity
5. Jotform — form accessibility
6. Pipeline (E2E) — full onboarding path
7. CRM/Calendar — Google Cal, Jobber
8. Infrastructure — Railway services, DNS, webhooks
9. Client Health — per-client agent status
10. Revenue — billing cycles, overages

### Alert Channels
- Email: SMTP2GO REST API (not nodemailer — Railway blocks SMTP ports)
- SMS: Telnyx
- Daily digest: 8am CT

### Key Ops Monitor Learnings
- **Never POST to webhooks for health checks** — always HEAD. POST triggers real n8n execution.
- `is_published` on Retell agents is NOT a health indicator — agents work immediately after creation
- alertManager crash pattern: if alertManager throws on startup, entire monitor silently returns null
- Railway build cache: env var changes don't always trigger redeploy — sometimes need a new git commit

To unpause ops monitor:
```
POST https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2
Authorization: Bearer {{RAILWAY_TOKEN}}
mutation { sleepApplication(serviceId: "7ce0f943-5216-4a16-8aeb-794cc7cc1e65", sleep: false) }
```

## Key Operational Rules

1. **Never delete or recreate a Retell agent** — always patch in place
2. **Always publish after Retell API updates** — `POST /publish-agent/{agent_id}`
3. **After any n8n edits, click Publish** to make active version live
4. **GitHub secret scanning** blocks raw tokens — always use placeholder variables before pushing
5. **n8n PUT workflow** requires only `name`, `nodes`, `connections`, `settings.executionOrder`
6. **Gmail mobile dark mode** auto-converts light-theme emails — this is correct behaviour, not a bug
7. **Base64 SVG images break in Gmail mobile** — always use hosted PNG URLs
8. **WhatsApp Business rejects VoIP numbers** — need real SIM
9. **Avoid over-engineering** support tooling before clients exist
10. **Hamburger menu:** NEVER build from scratch — always copy from existing page
11. **Agent prompts:** always use commas instead of dashes
12. **`daniel@syntharra.com` must never appear** in workflows or on the website
13. **`invoice_creation`** is incompatible with `mode: 'subscription'` in Stripe — subscriptions auto-create invoices

## 🔄 Auto-Update Rule

**Whenever you complete any task that touches this skill's domain, you MUST update this SKILL.md before the chat ends.**

This includes:
- New n8n workflow created or renamed → update the workflow table
- New Supabase table or column added → update the tables section
- New Jotform field added → update field mappings
- API key or credential changed → update the keys section
- New Retell agent created → update agent IDs
- Stripe product/price/coupon added or changed → update Stripe section
- New Railway service created → update infrastructure section
- New website page created → update file map
- Any webhook URL changed → update webhook URLs
- Any new learnings or gotchas discovered → add to key rules/learnings

**How:** At end of chat, fetch this file from GitHub, apply changes with `str.replace()`, push back.
**GitHub push function:** See `syntharra-ops` skill for the standard push pattern.
