  Full reference for running, debugging, and extending the Syntharra HVAC Standard E2E test.
  ALWAYS load this skill when: running the Standard pipeline E2E test, debugging a failed E2E run,
  adding a new field to the onboarding pipeline (Jotform, Supabase, or Retell), verifying a new
  client was provisioned correctly, checking whether a recent n8n change broke onboarding, or any
  task involving shared/e2e-test.py. The test covers the full pipeline: Jotform webhook → n8n
  onboarding → Supabase → Retell agent + conversation flow → call processor → hvac_call_log.
  Current status: 98 assertions (updated 2026-04-04). Run with: python3 shared/e2e-test.py

# E2E Test — HVAC Standard Agent

> **Status: 98 assertions — Updated 2026-04-04 for Retell-native fields. Call processor verified green.**

## What It Tests

Complete Standard pipeline end-to-end, 98 assertions across 7 phases:

| Phase | What's checked |
|---|---|
| 1 | Jotform webhook → HTTP 200 |
| 2 | n8n onboarding workflow → `success` (polling, up to 45s) |
| 3 | Supabase `hvac_standard_agent` — 40+ fields all populated |
| 4 | Retell agent — exists, published, correct voice/webhook/language |
| 5 | Conversation flow — exactly 12 nodes, correct structure |
| 6 | Call processor — fake call with full Retell post-call analysis payload, 30+ fields verified |
| 7 | Stripe gate — Twilio correctly skipped in test mode |

Self-cleaning: test agent, flow, and Supabase row auto-deleted 5 min after run.

## Call Processor — Retell-Native Architecture (post-enhancement 2026-04-04)

The E2E test's fake webhook payload now includes the full `call_analysis.custom_analysis_data` structure
that Retell would provide. The n8n call processor reads these fields directly — no LLM calls in n8n.

### Fake webhook payload structure (Phase 6)
```python
fake_call = {
    "event": "call_analyzed",
    "call": {
        "call_id": ..., "agent_id": ...,
        "duration_ms": 120000, "from_number": ..., "to_number": ...,
        "recording_url": ..., "public_log_url": ..., "transcript": ...,
        "call_analysis": {
            "call_summary": ...,        # system preset
            "call_successful": True,     # system preset
            "user_sentiment": "Neutral", # system preset
            "custom_analysis_data": {
                "caller_name": ..., "caller_phone": ..., "caller_address": ...,
                "service_requested": ..., "call_type": ..., "urgency": ...,
                "is_hot_lead": ..., "lead_score": 8, "job_type": ...,
                "language": "en", "booking_attempted": False, ...
            }
        },
        "call_cost": {"total_duration_unit_price": 0.14},
        "latency": {"e2e": {"p50": 1100}, "llm": {"p50": 650}}
    }
}
```

### Phase 6 assertions (15 new fields added 2026-04-04)
- retell_sentiment, retell_summary, call_successful (system presets)
- urgency, call_type, notification_type, job_type (custom analysis)
- is_hot_lead, language (custom analysis)
- duration_seconds, recording_url, latency_p50_ms, call_cost_cents (webhook direct)
- caller_address, notes (custom analysis)

### Known issue: HubSpot Code node
The HubSpot — Log Call Note node fails with "access to env vars denied" in n8n.
This is a pre-existing issue (n8n restricts `$env` in Code nodes). The Supabase write
succeeds — the HubSpot error is downstream and does not affect call logging.
The n8n execution shows "error" but the core pipeline (extract → log) works correctly.

---

## Execution Polling Pattern

**Always poll — never flat sleep** for n8n execution checks:

```python
for attempt in range(9):   # up to 45s
    time.sleep(5)
    _, execs = http(f".../executions?workflowId={WF_ID}&limit=3",
        headers={"X-N8N-API-KEY": N8N_KEY})
    candidates = [e for e in (execs.get('data') or [])
                  if e.get('status') in ('success','error','crashed')]
    if candidates:
        exec_status = candidates[0].get('status')
        break
```

---

## Adding a New Field to the Pipeline

When adding a new Jotform field that must reach Supabase:

1. **Parse JotForm Data node** (n8n `4Hx7aRdzMl5N0uJP`) — add mapping: `new_field: clean(formData.qXX_fieldName)`
2. **Build Retell Prompt extractedData** — add: `new_field: data.new_field || null`
3. **Merge LLM & Agent Data node** — add: `new_field: ed.new_field || null`
4. **E2E test payload** — add the Jotform field key + value
5. **E2E test assertion** — add `check("new_field saved", row.get('new_field') == expected_value, ...)`
6. **Run test** — verify 75+1/76 passing
7. **Update this skill** + `retell-agents/HVAC-STANDARD-AGENT-TEMPLATE.md`

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 2 fails (`exec status unknown`) | n8n slow | Increase polling attempts (9×5s = 45s default) |
| Phase 3 field null | Wrong Jotform key in Parse node or test payload | Check key against Jotform form `260795139953066` |
| Phase 5 wrong node count | Template changed in n8n | Check Build Retell Prompt node — must build 12 nodes |
| Phase 6 call not logged | Webhook path or payload format wrong | Verify `/webhook/retell-hvac-webhook` active AND payload includes `custom_analysis_data` |
| Cleanup doesn't fire | Cleanup workflow paused | Unpause `URbQPNQP26OIdYMo` in n8n |

---

## Credential Access Rule
ALL Syntharra API keys live in Supabase `syntharra_vault`.
The E2E test embeds credentials directly for standalone operation — do not refactor to vault lookups.


---

## Pre-existing Issues (known, not blocking)

| Issue | Impact | Status |
|---|---|---|
| n8n onboarding workflow uses stale Retell API key | Phase 1-5 of E2E test fail | Needs key rotation in n8n workflow `4Hx7aRdzMl5N0uJP` |
| HubSpot Code node uses `$env` (restricted in n8n) | n8n execution shows "error" after Supabase write succeeds | Needs HubSpot node rewrite to use HTTP Request instead of Code |

These issues predate the enhancement sprint and do not affect call processing.

## Agent Simulator — Operational Patterns

### Rate limiting in parallel runs
- Running 6 groups simultaneously hammers OpenAI RPM limits
- Symptoms: `[rate limit — waiting 20s]` messages + evaluator gets degraded context → false FAILs
- **Rule: never run more than 2 groups in parallel**
- **Rule: run targeted scenario IDs first (`--scenarios 18,21,23`) to validate fixes before full group runs**

### Evaluator variance
- The same scenario can PASS or FAIL across runs due to LLM evaluator stochasticity
- A single FAIL on an otherwise passing scenario is usually variance, not a real regression
- **Rule: before fixing a failure, run the failing scenario 2x in isolation — if it passes once, it's variance**
- Cost: ~$0.002 per retest — always worth it before changing the prompt

### When to fix the scenario vs fix the agent
Two types of failures exist — treat them differently:

| Type | Signal | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Real agent failure** | Transcript shows Sophie doing the wrong thing | Fix the prompt/node |
| **Bad scenario** | Transcript shows Sophie doing the right thing, evaluator fails anyway | Fix `expectedBehaviour` in scenarios.json |
| **Evaluator mismatch** | expectedBehaviour conflicts with our prompt design | Fix expectedBehaviour to match correct behaviour |

Examples of bad scenarios fixed this session:
- #55 job applicant: Sophie correctly redirected to website + collected contact — evaluator failed because expectedBehaviour said "routes appropriately" (too vague). Fixed: clarified expectedBehaviour to match correct handling.
- #21 distracted: Sophie correctly re-anchored — but callerPrompt never actually simulated interruptions. Fixed: callerPrompt updated to include explicit "hold on — [kids] — I'm back" moments.

### Scenario callerPrompt quality rule
- If `expectedBehaviour` requires Sophie to demonstrate a behaviour (e.g. re-anchor after interruption), the `callerPrompt` MUST actually trigger that scenario
- Before fixing Sophie for failing #21-type tests, read the transcript — if the triggering event never happened, fix the scenario

### Evaluator criteria count
- The evaluator derives criteria from `expectedBehaviour` — each comma/and-joined clause = 1 criterion
- Vague expectedBehaviour → inconsistent criteria count → inconsistent pass/fail
- Write expectedBehaviour as explicit, testable actions: "Acknowledges, redirects to team, collects name + number, does not go through service flow"

### Batch run timeout strategy
- Full 15-scenario group takes 3-4 minutes solo, 8+ minutes with rate limiting
- Tool execution limit is ~3 minutes
- Strategy: run `--scenarios` for targeted tests (fast, <90s for 5 scenarios), then full `--group` only for final confirmation
- Always use `timeout 150` to prevent hangs
